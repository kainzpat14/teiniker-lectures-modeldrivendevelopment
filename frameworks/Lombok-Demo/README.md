# Lombok

Lombok is an annotation processing library that uses the JavaC or ECJ internal datastructures to modify java code upon compilation. By doing this it provides a number of utilities to write more concise code. 

Examples can be found in src/test/java/LombokTest

NOTE: In order to get this code to compile in your IDE, you will likely need to follow one of the guides at 	https://projectlombok.org/ in the Install menu.
