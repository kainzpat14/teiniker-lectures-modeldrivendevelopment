# Static Analysis

The code of this project has been provided by a generous donor for your studies. Just 
as with normal projects, the code here is far from optimal. Still you should be able to
read, understand and use it. 

## General hints
In the following part you will be asked to answer questions. Some of those questions 
will require you to describe the code you see. This does not mean that you should 
simply turn the code into language. The following code: 

```java
    int sum = 0;
    for(int i = 0;i<matrix.length;i++)
    {
        sum+=matrix[i][i];   
    }
    Assert.assertEquals(10,sum);
```

Cannot be described as: 
```
Sum is initialized with 0. The variable "i" is counted from
0 to matrix.length and we add the value of the matrix at first index = i and second index
= i to sum. Finally, we check if sum has value 10. 
```
That would just be reading the code symbol by symbol, which I assume any programmer can 
do. Instead, you should prove your understanding of the code: 
```
This code checks if the diagonal sum of a matrix is 10. 
```

## Intro

This one is a difficult one (except for slovenian speaking people), you should not google
the words and take this as an exercise in understanding obfuscated code. It took me also 
about 30 minutes to figure it out, something like this will not be part of any exam.


## Tasks

Please complete the following tasks: 

1) Describe what this code helps you do (its something you probably already did at some point in your life).
